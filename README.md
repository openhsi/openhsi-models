### ZEMAX Opitcal Design Notes
- The optical design make use of Zemax Black Box lens and perscriptions provided by Edmund Optics. These reamin the propety of the respective manufactures.
- A Black Box was not avalive for the field lens, so a Paraxial Perfect lens is used with the same f/# and focal length.
